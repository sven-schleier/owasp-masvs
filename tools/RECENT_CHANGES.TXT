## V1.3 - 11 May 2021

We are proud to announce the introduction of a new document build pipeline, which is major milestone for our project. The build pipeline is based on [Pandocker](https://github.com/dalibo/pandocker) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/tree/master/.github/workflows). This significantly reduces the time spent on creating new releases. We would like to thank:

- Jeroen Willemsen for kick-starting this initiative last year!
- Damien Clochard and Dalibo for supporting and professionalizing the build pipeline.

The build pipeline will also be the foundation for the OWASP MSTG and will be made available for the OWASP ASVS project.

The following changes are part of release 1.3:

- 4 more translations are available, which are Hindi, Farsi, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese
- Added requirement MSTG-PLATFORM-11
