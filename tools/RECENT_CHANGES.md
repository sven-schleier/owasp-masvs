We are proud to announce the introduction of a new document build pipeline, which is a major milestone for our project. The build pipeline is based on [Pandocker](https://github.com/dalibo/pandocker) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/tree/master/.github/workflows).
This significantly reduces the time spent on creating new releases and will also be the foundation for the OWASP MSTG and will be made available for the OWASP ASVS project.

### Changes

- 4 more translations are available, which are Hindi, Farsi, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese
- Added requirement MSTG-PLATFORM-11

### Special Thanks

- Jeroen Willemsen for kick-starting this initiative last year!
- Damien Clochard and Dalibo for supporting and professionalizing the build pipeline.
- All our Hindi, Farsi, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese collaborators for the excellent translation work.
